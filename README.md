# How to install and Inject

1. [Download the latest version of gd-hacks](https://github.com/Skyue1/gd-hacks/releases)
2. Download any injector, but i recommend Process Hacker (also if DLL did not get injected the first time try again)
3. Select the GeometryDash.exe process and inject the DLL
4. After everything has been successfully injected you can open the menu by pressing the TAB button.
